# uBlock

The purpose of this repository is to:

* Host additional files such as custom filter rules for uBlock extension.

* Not to loose custom filter rules that were created over time when reinstalling the operating system.
   
* Having the same custom filter rules applied on different browsers or different operating systems with just a single URL.

#### Custom filters

* Block annoying random divisions in page if uBlock has been detected.


Ex: A random div message
![Inbox Lv](/assets/images/inbox_lv__div.png)
The fix is to block the div that starts with a specific prefix and then fix the window scrollbar
#### Adding custom filter rules to uBlock

Click the icon of uBlock and then click on gears icon.

`Settings -> Filter Lists -> Custom -> Import`

To get the **URL** from GitHub repository click on the file that you wish to add and then select **RAW** then copy and paste the URL from the browsers address bar into uBlock textbox.
