# Adblock Plus

The purpose of this repository is to:

1. Host additional files such as custom filter rules for Adblock Plus extension.

2. Not to loose the custom filter rules that were created over time when reinstalling the operating system.
   
3. Having the same custom filter rules on different browsers or different operating systems with just a single URL link.

#### Custom filters

1. Block annoying random divisions in page if adblock has been detected.


Ex: Google message detected adblock

The fix is to block googletagmanager.com domain
